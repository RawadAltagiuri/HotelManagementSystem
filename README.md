• Welcome, firstly you will need some softwares setup: Software needed: 

I. A Java IDE (such as NetBeans) 

II. Apache’s XAMPP which is a web server solution package. (Set up video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL3jfSxFzu4) 
III. MySQL.

Then after installing them:

•you need to run XAMPP and then press “Start” on the MySQL option and APACHE option. 

• If you do not have the database installed there already then next step is to press on the admin option in XAMPP next to the MySQL, this will take you to the phpMyAdmin server, there you just need to create a database, then go to the import option in the database, and import the SQL filed we have given you (Named HMS.SQL) 

• Go onto your Java IDE and from file tab press on open project and pick our project. 

• Run the program. 

• You will be faced with a login screen and you can use either of these two users:
